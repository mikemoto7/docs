
1. All of the scripts have help screens.  Use the following to display a help screen:

   script_name   # No parameters needed.  This is the most reliable method.

   script_name -h      # may not be implemented
   script_name --help      # may not be implemented

2. For most of the modules I created, I added a main function to them so they can be called by themselves or as modules.
